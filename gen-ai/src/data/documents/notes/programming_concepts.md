# Programming Concepts and Patterns

## Core Programming Principles

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods together, hiding internal implementation details
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing classes, inheriting properties and methods
- **Polymorphism**: Same interface, different implementations; method overriding and overloading
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details, exposing only essential features
- **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion

### Functional Programming
- **Pure Functions**: Functions that always return same output for same input, no side effects
- **Immutability**: Data structures that cannot be modified after creation
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as parameters or return functions
- **Lambda Functions**: Anonymous functions defined inline
- **Map, Filter, Reduce**: Functional operations for transforming collections
- **Closures**: Functions that capture variables from their lexical scope

### Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Contiguous memory allocation, O(1) access, O(n) insertion/deletion
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic allocation, O(n) access, O(1) insertion/deletion at head
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure, push/pop operations
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out) structure, enqueue/dequeue operations
- **Hash Tables**: Key-value pairs, O(1) average case lookup, collision handling
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structure, binary trees, balanced trees (AVL, Red-Black)
- **Graphs**: Vertices and edges, directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted

### Algorithms
- **Sorting**: Bubble sort O(nÂ²), Quick sort O(n log n) average, Merge sort O(n log n)
- **Searching**: Linear search O(n), Binary search O(log n), Hash table lookup O(1)
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS O(V+E), DFS O(V+E), Dijkstra's shortest path O((V+E) log V)
- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking problems into overlapping subproblems, memoization
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Making locally optimal choices at each step
- **Divide and Conquer**: Breaking problems into smaller subproblems, solving recursively

### Design Patterns
- **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype, Abstract Factory

- **Dependency Injection**: Providing dependencies from external sources

### Memory Management
- **Stack Memory**: Automatic allocation/deallocation, function calls, local variables
- **Heap Memory**: Dynamic allocation, manual management, global variables
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management, reference counting, mark-and-sweep
- **Memory Leaks**: Unreachable memory that cannot be freed

### Concurrency and Parallelism
- **Threads**: Lightweight processes sharing memory space
- **Processes**: Independent execution units with separate memory spaces
- **Race Conditions**: Unpredictable behavior when multiple threads access shared data
- **Deadlocks**: Circular waiting for resources between threads
- **Mutexes**: Mutual exclusion locks for thread synchronization
- **Semaphores**: Counting mechanisms for resource access control
- **Async/Await**: Asynchronous programming patterns for non-blocking operations

### Error Handling
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks, throwing and catching exceptions
- **Error Codes**: Return values indicating success or failure
- **Assertions**: Runtime checks for program correctness
- **Logging**: Recording program execution information for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating with reduced functionality
- **Fail-Safe Design**: System fails in a safe state

### Software Architecture
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Single deployable unit containing all functionality
- **Microservices**: Small, independent services communicating over network
- **Layered Architecture**: Separation into presentation, business, and data layers
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Components communicate through events
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Services expose functionality through interfaces
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Business logic isolated from external dependencies

### Testing Strategies
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interaction between components
- **System Testing**: Testing complete system functionality
- **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests before implementation
- **Mocking**: Creating fake objects for testing dependencies
- **Code Coverage**: Measuring percentage of code executed by tests

### Performance Optimization
- **Time Complexity**: Big O notation for algorithm efficiency
- **Space Complexity**: Memory usage analysis
- **Profiling**: Measuring program performance characteristics
- **Caching**: Storing frequently accessed data in fast storage
- **Lazy Loading**: Loading data only when needed
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing, query optimization, connection pooling

### Security Principles
- **Input Validation**: Checking and sanitizing user inputs
- **Authentication**: Verifying user identity
- **Authorization**: Controlling access to resources
- **Encryption**: Protecting data confidentiality
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using parameterized queries
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**: Sanitizing output data

### Version Control
- **Git Workflow**: Branching, merging, committing changes
- **Repository Management**: Local and remote repositories
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling merge conflicts
- **Branching Strategies**: Feature branches, release branches, main branch
- **Code Review**: Peer review of code changes
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment

### API Design

- **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for different operations
- **Status Codes**: HTTP response codes indicating request results
- **API Documentation**: Clear documentation of endpoints and parameters
- **Rate Limiting**: Controlling API usage frequency
- **Authentication**: API keys, OAuth, JWT tokens

### Database Concepts
- **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- **Normalization**: Reducing data redundancy in database design
- **Indexing**: Improving query performance with data structures
