$$
v(t)=\alpha i(t) . \tag{2.6}
$$
The proportionality constant a is the resistance of the wire as defined by the German physicist George Ohm.
$$
R=\frac{v(t)}{i(t)} \tag{2.7}
$$
$$
\overline{i(t)}
$$
It is critical to note that v(t) and i(t) must be in the passive sign convention
for the previous two equations to be valid. In other words, the voltage drop v(t)
across a resistor R is given by the product i(t)R, provided that i(t) enters the
resistor from the positive voltage node.
Ohm's law states that the voltage drop across an ideal resistor is linearly.
proportional to its current by a constant called the resistance as seen in 2.8
$$
v(t)=i(t) R \tag{2.8}
$$
Ohm's law can be used for any (ideal) resistor, but we will find out later that
not every material (or object) obeys Ohm's law.
Let us examine (2.8) more closely. What happens in Figure 2.7 if the resis-
tance R of the wire was very large, so large that it approaches infinity? Also.
what happens if the resistance is zero? For the first scenario, we rearrange.
Ohm's law as.
$$
=\frac{v(t)}{R} . \tag{2.9}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
i(t)=\frac{v(t)}{R}\\
\text { nfinity then the ratio } \frac{v(t)}{}
\end{array}
$$
If the resistance is approaching infinity then the ratio will go to zero, which.
$$
R
$$
means the current i(t) will be zero. Since no current can pass, this represents an
open circuit. For the second scenario, when the resistance is zero, the voltage
will be zero as well and the current will go to infinity. In other words we will
have a short circuit. Figure 2.8 shows these equivalent circuit representations.
