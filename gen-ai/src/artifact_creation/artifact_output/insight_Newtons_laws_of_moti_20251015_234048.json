      "takeaway": "Newton's first law states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a net external force, known as the law of inertia. Newton's second law defines the relationship between an object's acceleration, its mass, and the applied net force (F=ma). Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."
