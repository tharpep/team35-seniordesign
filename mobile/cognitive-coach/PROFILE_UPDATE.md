# Profile Page Integration - Complete

## Summary
Successfully updated the profile page to display authenticated user data from the backend instead of hardcoded fake data.

## Changes Made

### File: `mobile/cognitive-coach/app/profile.tsx`

#### What Changed:
1. **Added Authentication Integration**
   - Imported `useAuth` hook from AuthContext
   - Replaced hardcoded `userData` object with real user from authentication state
   
2. **Added Loading State**
   - Shows spinner while authentication state is loading
   - Displays "Loading profile..." message
   
3. **Added Route Protection**
   - Redirects to login page if user is not authenticated
   - Prevents unauthorized access to profile page

4. **Updated User Data Display**
   - **First Name**: Now displays `user.first_name` from backend
   - **Last Name**: Now displays `user.last_name` from backend  
   - **Email**: Now displays `user.email` from backend
   - **Member Since**: NEW - displays formatted `user.created_at` date
   - **Password Field**: REMOVED (not stored in user object for security)

5. **Updated Avatar**
   - Generates initials from authenticated user's actual name
   - Uses same pattern as dashboard

6. **Fixed Logout Function**
   - Now calls `await logout()` from AuthContext
   - Properly clears authentication state
   - Redirects to `/login` after logout

## User Object Structure

The profile page now uses the authenticated user object with this structure:
```typescript
{
  id: number;
  email: string;
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  created_at: string; // ISO date string
}
```

## Before & After

### Before:
- Displayed hardcoded fake data: "John Doe", "john.doe@email.com"
- Had password field with show/hide toggle
- Logout just navigated to login without clearing state
- No loading or auth checks

### After:
- Displays real user data from backend authentication
- Shows "Member Since" date instead of password
- Proper logout that clears auth state
- Loading state while fetching user data
- Redirects if not authenticated

## Testing

To test the profile page:
1. Start backend: `cd webapp/backend && npm start`
2. Start mobile app: `cd mobile/cognitive-coach && npm run ios`
3. Login with a test user
4. Navigate to dashboard
5. Tap the profile button (user initials in top right)
6. Verify profile shows your actual user information

## What's Next

The profile page integration is complete! Next steps for the mobile app:
- [ ] Session detail view (display full session info when tapping a session card)
- [ ] Materials/artifacts loading
- [ ] Study modes (flashcards, MCQ, equations)
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket updates for sessions

## Notes

- Profile page correctly matches the pattern used in the dashboard
- Uses same AuthContext and authentication flow
- Follows same styling conventions with Material Design tokens
- Backend session cookies handled automatically by axios
