DSA Intro DSA Simple Algorithm A data structure is a way to store data. Arrays We structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.. DSA Arrays First, let's consider an example without computers in mind, just to get the DSA Bubble Sort DSA Selection Sort idea. DSA Insertion Sort If we want to store data about people we are related to, we use a family tree DSA Quick Sort as the data structure.We choose a family tree as the data structure because

DSA Counting Sort
we have information about people we are related to and how they are related
DSA Radix Sort
and we want an overview so that we can easily find a specific family member,
DSA Merge Sort

DSA Linear Search DSA Binary Search With such a family tree data structure visually in front of you, it is easy to see, for example, who my mother's mother isit is'Emma'right? But without the Linked Lists links from child to parents that this data structure provides, it would be difficult to determine how the individuals are related. DSA Linked Lists Data structures give us the possibility to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet DSA Linked Lists in Memory

Data structures are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms. They help in managing and organizing data,
reduce complexity, and increase efficiency
