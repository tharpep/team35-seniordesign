Qualitative Data and Uncertainty When reacting HCl with the powdered eggshells, a huge amount of white foam was produced, making it difficult for the transfer of our new solution to another flask. When arriving at the final stage of titration, the solution in the conical flash (HCl solution + eggshell) turned close to pink, but some trials did not provide us with the colour fuchsia,

which is not the most accurate.
