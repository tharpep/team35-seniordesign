2.4 Resistive Power We recall from Section 1.1.3 that.

$$
p = vi \tag{2.12}
$$


results in consumed (absorbed) power if v and i are defined in the passive sign convention. Now, if we use Ohm's law to substitute for the current in (2.12), in terms of voltage and resistance we get.

$$
p = vi = \tag{2.13}
$$


which leads to (2.14) R Or we can find the power in terms of current by using Ohm's law to substitute for the voltage in (2.12) in terms of current and resistance to get

$$
p = vi = (iR)i, \tag{2.15}
$$


*Raw OCR (conf: 95.5%): p=vi=(iR)i,*


which leads to

$$
p = i^{2}R. \tag{2.16}
$$


*Raw OCR (conf: 93.3%): p = i2R.*


The term "resistive losses"' is often used to describe 2.16. From what we
