## 2.4 Resistive Power

We recall from Section 1.1.3 that.
$$
p=v i \tag{2.12}
$$
results in consumed (absorbed) power if v and i are defined in the passive sign
convention. Now, if we use Ohm's law to substitute for the current in (2.12), in
terms of voltage and resistance we get.
$$
p=v i=v\left(\frac{v}{R}\right) \tag{2.13}
$$
which leads to

$$
\boxed{p = \frac{v^2}{R}} \tag{2.14}
$$

Or we can find the power in terms of current by using Ohm's law to substitute for the voltage in (2.12) in terms of current and resistance to get
$$
p=v i=(i R) i \tag{2.15}
$$
which leads to

$$
\boxed{p = i^{2}R} \tag{2.16}
$$ The term "resistive losses"' is often used to describe 2.16. From what we
