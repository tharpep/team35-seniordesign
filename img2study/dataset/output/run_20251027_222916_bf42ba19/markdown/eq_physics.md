\text { Resistive Power }
$$
We recall from Section 1.1.3 that. $p=v i$

results in consumed (absorbed) power if v and i are defined in the passive sign
convention. Now, if we use Ohm's law to substitute for the current in (2.12), in
terms of voltage and resistance we get.
$$
p=v i=v\left(\frac{v}{R}\right) \tag{2.13}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\text { which leads to }\\
p=\frac{v^{2}}{R}
\end{array} \tag{2.14}
$$

Or we can find the power in terms of current by using Ohm's law to substitute for the voltage in (2.12) in terms of current and resistance to get $p=v i=(i R) i$ which leads to $p = i^{2}R$ \tag{2.16} The term "resistive losses"' is often used to describe 2.16. From what we
