Momentum, Impulse, and the Impulse-Momentum Theorem Linear momentum is the product of a system's mass and its velocity. In equation form, linear momentum p is p = mv. You can see from the equation that momentum is directly proportional to the object's mass (m) and velocity (v). Therefore, the greater an object's mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum. A large, fast-moving object has greater momentum than a smaller, slower object. Momentum is a vector and has the same direction as velocity v. Since mass is a scalar, when velocity is in a negative direction (i.e., opposite the direction of motion), the momentum will also be in a negative direction; and when velocity is in a positive direction, momentum will likewise be in a positive direction. The SI unit for momentum is kg m/s. Momentum is so important for understanding motion that it was called the quantity of motion by physicists such as Newton. Force influences momentum, and we can rearrange Newton's second law of motion to show the relationship between force and momentum. Recall our study of Newton's second law of motion (Fnet = ma). Newton actually stated his second law of motion in terms of momentum: The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes. The change in momentum is the difference between the final and initial values of momentum. In equation form, this law is
$$
In equation form, this law is
\[
\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{net}}=\frac{\Delta \mathbf{p}}{\Delta t},
\]
where \( \mathbf{F}_{\text {net }} \) is the net external force, \( \Delta \mathbf{p} \) is the change in momentum, and \( \Delta t \) is the change in time.
We can solve for \( \Delta \mathbf{p} \) by rearranging the equation
\[
\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{net}}=\frac{\Delta \mathbf{p}}{\Delta t}
\]
to be
$$
Ap = Fnet t. Fnet t is known as impulse and this equation is known as the impulse-momentum theorem. From the equation, we see that the impulse equals the average net external force multiplied by the time this force acts. It is equal to the change in momentum. The effect of a force on an object depends on how long it acts, as well as the strength of the force. Impulse is a useful concept. because it quantifies the effect of a force. A very large force acting for a short time can have a great effect on the momentum of an object, such as the force of a racket hitting a tennis ball. A small force could cause the same change in momentum, but it would have to act for a much longer time.
