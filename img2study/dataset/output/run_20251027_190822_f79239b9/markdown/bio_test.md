| Cells | are | too | small | for | you | to | be | able | to | see. | Although | there | are | exceptions, | a | typical | eukaryotic | cell | is | 10 | to | 100 | micrometers | (m) | in | diameter, | and | most |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| prokaryotic | cells | are | only | 1 | to | 10 | m | in | diameter. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Because | cells | are | so | small, | they | were | not | discovered | until | the | invention | of | the | microscope | in | the | 17th | century. | English | natural | philosopher | Robert | Hooke | was | the |  |  |  |
| first | to | observe | cells | in | 1665, | naming | the | shapes | he | saw | in | cork | cellulae | (Latin, | "small | rooms"). | They | are | known | to | us | as | cells. | Another | early | microscopist, | Dutch |  |
| Anton | van | Leeuwenhoek, | first | observed | living | cells, | which | he | termed | "animalcules," | or | little | animals. | After | these | early | efforts, | a | century | and | a | half | passed | before. |  |  |  |  |
| biologists | fully | recognized | the | importance | of | cells. | In | 1838, | German | botanist | Matthias | Schleiden | stated | that | all | plants | "are | aggregates | of | fully | individualized,. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| independent, | separate | beings, | namely | the | cells | themselves." | In | 1839, | German | physiologist | Theodor | Schwann | reported | that | all | animal | tissues | also | consist | of. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| individual | cells. | Thus, | the | cell | theory | was | born. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Cell theory is the unifying foundation of cell biology

| The | cell | theory | was | proposed | to | explain | the | observation | that | all | organisms | are | composed | of | cells. | It | sounds | simple, | but | it | is | a | far-reaching | statement | about | the |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| organization | of | life. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| In | its | modern | form, | the | cell | theory | includes | the | following | three | principles: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 1. | All | organisms | are | composed | of | one | or | more | cells, | and | the | life | processes | of | metabolism | and | heredity | occur | within | these | cells. |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2. | Cells | are | the | smallest | living | things, | the | basic | units | of | organization | of | all | organisms. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3. | Cells | arise | only | by | division | of | a | previously | existing | cell. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Although life likely evolved spontaneously in the environment of early Earth, biologists have concluded that no additional cells are originating spontaneously at present. Rather, life on Earth represents a continuous line of descent from those early cells.
