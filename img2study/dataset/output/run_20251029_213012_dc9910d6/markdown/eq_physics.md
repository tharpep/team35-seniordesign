2.4 We recall from Section 1.1.3 that.
$$
\[
p=v i
\]
results in consumed (absorbed) power if \( v \) and \( i \) are defined in the passive sign convention. Now, if we use Ohm's law to substitute for the current in, in terms of voltage and resistance we get \tag{2.12}
$$
$p=v i=v\left(\frac{v}{R}\right)$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\text { which leads to }\\
p=\frac{v^{2}}{R}
\end{array} \tag{2.14}
$$
$$
\[
p=\frac{v^{2}}{R} .
\]

Or we can find the power in terms of current by using Ohm's law to substitute for the voltage in in terms of current and resistance to get
\[
p=v i=(i R) i,
\] \tag{2.12}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
p=i^{2} R\\
\text { The term "resistive losses" is often used to describe } 2.16 \text {. From what we }
\end{array} \tag{2.16}
$$
