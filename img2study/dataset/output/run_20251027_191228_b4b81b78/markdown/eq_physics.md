Resistive Power 2.4 We recall from Section 1.1.3 that. $$ p=v i $$ $$ \text { (2.12) } $$ results in consumed (absorbed) power if v and i are defined in the passive sign convention.

Now, if we use Ohm's law to substitute for the current in (2.12), in terms of voltage and resistance we get. $$ p=v i=v\left(\frac{0}{D}\right), $$ *MathPix confidence: 67.4%* which leads to (2.14) R Or we can find the power in terms of current by using Ohm's law to substitute for the voltage in (2.12) in terms of current and resistance to get $$ p=v i=(i R) i, $$ $$ (2.15) $$ which leads to p = i2R. (2.16) The term "resistive losses"' is often used to describe 2.16.
