2.4 Resistive Power We recall from Section 1.1.3 that.

$$
p = vi \tag{2.12}
$$


results in consumed (absorbed) power if v and i are defined in the passive sign convention. Now, if we use Ohm's law to substitute for the current in (2.12), in terms of voltage and resistance we get.

$p = vi = (2.13)$ (2.13)

*Raw OCR (conf: 94.7%): p =vi =*


which leads to R.

Or we can find the power in terms of current by using Ohm's law to substitute for the voltage in (2.12) in terms of current and resistance to get

$$
p = vi = (iR)i, \tag{2.15}
$$


*Raw OCR (conf: 99.4%): p=vi=(iR)i,*


which leads to

$$
p = i?R. \tag{2.16}
$$


The term "resistive losses" is often used to describe 2.16. From what we
