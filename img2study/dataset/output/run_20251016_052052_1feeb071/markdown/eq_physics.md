Resistive Power

We recall from Section 1.1.3 that.

$$
p = vi
$$


$$
 \tag{2.12}
$$


results in consumed (absorbed) power if v and i are defined in the passive sign

convention. Now, if we use Ohm's law to substitute for the current in (2.12), in

terms of voltage and resistance we get.

$$
p = vi =
$$


$$
 \tag{2.13}
$$


which leads to

$$
 \tag{2.14}
$$


R

Or we can find the power in terms of current by using Ohm's law to substitute

for the voltage in (2.12) in terms of current and resistance to get

$$
p = vi = (iR)i,
$$


*Raw OCR (conf: 98.4%): p=vi=(iR)i,*


$$
 \tag{2.15}
$$


which leads to

$$
p = i^{2}R.
$$


*Raw OCR (conf: 91.0%): p = i2R.*


$$
 \tag{2.16}
$$


The term "resistive losses"' is often used to describe 2.16. From what we
